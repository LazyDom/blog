## Hak5 WiFi Pineapple Pager: A Modern Classic

Untethered from a computer, the WiFi Pineapple Pager is a standalone pentest experience.

- **Retro Vibes, Modern Tech:** The WiFi Pineapple Pager channels the iconic look of the Motorola pagers from cult classics like _Hackers_ ("Hack the Planet!"), blending nostalgia with cutting-edge wireless security. Also, reminds me of [this awesome Pwnagotchi pager mod](https://cyberspacemanmike.com/2024/04/17/hackers-pwnagotchi-pager-case-on-talking-sasquatch/). Go check out, for more retro hacking inspiration. :pager: :satellite: :pineapple: :zap:
- **Feature Highlights:**
  - Compact, pocket-friendly design
  - Powerful WiFi auditing and penetration testing capabilities
  - OLED display for instant feedback
  - USB-C charging and data
  - _Available for pre-order at [Hak5.org](https://hak5.org/) as of this writing!_

- **Extensibility Unleashed:** Thanks to Hak5’s open mod/add-on ecosystem, the Pager is more than a tool—it’s a platform. Community mods are already in the works like GPS modules, Ethernet adapters, or additional radios, including early support for **Meshtastic** mesh networking.
- **On the Bleeding Edge:** While WiFi 7 support isn’t here yet (Hey! I can't complain since the standard was only ratified 3 days ago! as of this writing. Also, its tricky with new WiFi standards as it takes a while for a good chipset to have drivers capable of doing the monitor/inject necessary for WiFi Pineapple), Hak5’s rapid innovation means future-proofing is always top of mind. I hear screams for another add-on to support WiFi 7 :joy: :rocket: :signal_strength:
- **Why It’s a Game Changer:** Whether you’re a pentester, wireless enthusiast, or just love cool gadgets, the Pineapple Pager is designed to be hacked, modded, and shared.
